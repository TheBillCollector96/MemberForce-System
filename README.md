# MemberForce - System

This Repository contains the source files of a Security System which can be implemented to enhance the security levels and ensure efficiency in handling security protocols and procedures within any University or Educational Institution.
The system was built as a project for the module CMPG223 by RK Mtileni (38342626 - Leader), TM Hlatshwayo (38640406), A Mpitula (37460366), J Mlangeni (35171995), & P Sigama (42038758).
The system was built using C# together with a MySQL Database for operations and record keeping purposes, and works a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can be installed on a PC using Windows.
The system consists of 3 main features to achieve its goal namely "Student Permit Generator", "Report Misconducting Student", and "Student Residence Visitor".
It works as follow:

### Student Permit Generator

Integrated with all current records of all registered and enrolled students at a particular university or institute.
Therefore, if a student has forgotten their student card or lost it, the student is able to generate a temporary permit using their student number to use around campus for the day.
This is very helpful especially if the student is writing a crucial test or exam for identification purposes.
However, student only has 5 attempts each month to generate a temporary permit, therefore, if student has lost their student card, then student has to fix such issues on campus while the attempts are still sufficient, otherwise, student will not be allowed to enter the premises.

### Report Misconducting Student

Integrated with all current records of all registered and enrolled studnets at a particular university or institute.
Therefore, if one of the security members of the university catches a student violating established rules and policies of the university, the member can report such incidents much quicker and efficient with the system.
The member will have to search for the student using their student number and fill in all details about the misconduct.
The system allows access for the disciplinary committee to receive and process all the misconduct report accordingly.

### Student Residence Visitor

Integrated with all current records of all registered and enrolled studnets at a particular university or institute who are assigned to the University Residences only.
This allows record keeping and maintenance of all visitors that are signed in on a daily at all university residences.
A student who's only autherised to sign in visitors at their own particular resident which they were asigned to can use their student number together with their visitor's details to sign the visitor in.
Furthermore, the security member who's responsible for further authorising the visitor to enter the premises can monitor and manage the visitors which are currently signed in.
Moreover, the system also keeps track of time and doesn't allow further signing in of visitors after an assigned curfew.
It also generates a list of visitors which are still on premises and not signed out after curfew for the member to follow up on to ensure efficiency of student visitors' strict policies.
